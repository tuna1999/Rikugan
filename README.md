# Rikugan (六眼)

A reverse-engineering agent for **IDA Pro** and **Binary Ninja** that integrates a multi-provider LLM directly in your analysis UI. This project was done together with my friend, Claude Code.

## Is this another MCP client?

No, Rikugan is an ***agent*** built to live inside your RE host (**IDA Pro or Binary Ninja**). It does not consume an MCP server to interact with the host database; it has its own agentic loop, context management, its own role prompt (you can check it [here](rikugan/agent/system_prompt.py)), and an in-process tool orchestration layer.

The agent loop is a generator-based turn cycle: each user message kicks off a stream→execute→repeat pipeline where the LLM response is streamed token-by-token, tool calls are intercepted and dispatched.

The results are fed back as the next turn's context. It supports automatic error recovery, mid-run user questions, plan mode for multi-step workflows, and message queuing, all without leaving the disassembler.

The agent really ***lives*** and ***breathes*** reversing.

Advantages:

- No need to switch to an external MCP client such as Claude Code
- Assistant first, not made to do your job (unless you ask it)
- Expandable to many LLM providers and local installations (Ollama)
- Quick enabling, just hit Ctrl+Shift+I and the chat will appear

Also, building agents is an amazing area of study, especially coding with them.

| **Host-specific prompts** | Each host gets a tailored system prompt with correct terminology |


## Requirements

- IDA Pro 9.0+ with Hex-Rays decompiler (recommended), or Binary Ninja (UI mode)
- Python 3.9+
- At least one LLM provider
- Windows, macOS, or Linux


## Installation

Clone this repository, then run the installer for your target host:

**IDA Pro (Linux / macOS):**
```bash
./install_ida.sh
```

**IDA Pro (Windows):**
```bat
install_ida.bat
```

**Binary Ninja (Linux / macOS):**
```bash
./install_binaryninja.sh
```

**Binary Ninja (Windows):**
```bat
install_binaryninja.bat
```

All scripts auto-detect the user directory for their host. If detection fails (or you have a non-standard setup), pass the path explicitly:

```bash
./install_ida.sh /path/to/ida/user/dir
install_ida.bat "C:\Users\you\AppData\Roaming\Hex-Rays\IDA Pro"
./install_binaryninja.sh /path/to/binaryninja/user/dir
install_binaryninja.bat "C:\Users\you\AppData\Roaming\Binary Ninja"
```

Installers create plugin links/junctions, install dependencies, and initialize host-specific Rikugan config directories.

### Set your API key

Rikugan has a settings dialog to configure your model of choice. Open Rikugan → click Settings → paste your key.

- IDA config: `~/.idapro/rikugan/config.json`
- Binary Ninja config: `~/.binaryninja/rikugan/config.json` (or platform-equivalent user dir)

**Anthropic OAuth:** If you have Claude Code installed and authenticated, Rikugan auto-detects the OAuth token from the macOS Keychain. On other platforms, paste your API key manually or run `claude setup-token`.



## Usage

### Open the panel

IDA Pro: press **Ctrl+Shift+I** or go to **Edit → Plugins → Rikugan**.

Binary Ninja: use **Tools → Rikugan → Open Panel** or use the icon on the right

### Multi-tab chat

Each tab is an independent conversation with its own message history and context. Use the **+** button to create a new tab, or close tabs you no longer need. Tabs are tied to the current file — opening a different database starts a fresh set of tabs, and returning to a file restores its saved conversations.

### Chat export

Right-click a tab or click the **Export** button to save a conversation as Markdown. Tool calls and results are formatted with language-appropriate syntax highlighting (`c` for decompiled code, `x86asm` for disassembly, `python` for scripts, etc.).

### Script approval

The `execute_python` tool always asks for your permission before running. You see the full Python code with syntax highlighting in a scrollable preview, and can **Allow** or **Deny** each execution. The agent can never run the target binary on your machine.

### Message queuing

You can send messages while the agent is working. They appear as `[queued]` in the chat and auto-submit when the current turn finishes. Hit **Stop** to cancel the running turn and discard all queued messages.

### Quick actions

IDA Pro exposes these under right-click menus.
Binary Ninja exposes equivalent commands under **Tools → Rikugan** and address-context command menus.

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Send to Rikugan** | Pre-fills input with selection (Ctrl+Shift+A in IDA) |
| **Explain this** | Auto-explains the current function |
| **Rename with Rikugan** | Analyzes and renames with evidence |
| **Deobfuscate with Rikugan** | Systematic deobfuscation |
| **Find vulnerabilities** | Security audit |
| **Suggest types** | Infers types from usage patterns |
| **Annotate function** | Adds comments to decompiled code |
| **Clean microcode / IL** | Identifies and NOPs junk instructions |
| **Xref analysis** | Deep cross-reference tracing |

### Skills

Skills are reusable analysis workflows. Type `/` in the input area to see available skills with autocomplete.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|

| `/linux-malware` | ELF malware — packing, persistence, IOC extraction |
| `/deobfuscation` | String decryption, CFF removal, opaque predicates, MBA simplification |
| `/vuln-audit` | Buffer overflows, format strings, integer issues, memory safety |

Create custom skills in:

- IDA: `~/.idapro/rikugan/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`
- Binary Ninja: `~/.binaryninja/rikugan/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`

Each skill lives in its own subdirectory.

```
~/.idapro/rikugan/skills/      # or ~/.binaryninja/rikugan/skills/
  my-skill/
    SKILL.md            # required — frontmatter + prompt body
    references/         # optional — .md files appended to the prompt
      api-notes.md
```

Skill format:
```markdown
---
name: My Custom Skill
description: What it does in one line
tags: [analysis, custom]
allowed_tools: [decompile_function, rename_function]
---
Task: <instruction for the agent>

## Approach
...
```

The `allowed_tools` field is optional — when set, the agent can only use those tools while the skill is active.

### MCP Servers

Connect external MCP servers to extend Rikugan with additional tools. Create the config file at:

- IDA: `~/.idapro/rikugan/mcp.json`
- Binary Ninja: `~/.binaryninja/rikugan/mcp.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "binary-ninja": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "binaryninja_mcp"],
      "env": {},
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

MCP servers are started when the plugin loads. Their tools appear alongside built-in ones with the prefix `mcp_<server>_<tool>` — the agent sees them in the tool list and can call them like any other tool. Set `"enabled": false` to keep a server configured without starting it.

## Tools

56 tools per host, organized by category. 50 tools are shared across both hosts with identical interfaces. Each host adds 6 host-specific tools for its native intermediate representation.

## Conclusion

If you'd asked me last year what I think about AI doing reverse engineering, I'd probably have said something like "Nah, impossible, it hallucinates, reverse engineering is not something as simple as code", but this year I completely changed my mind when I saw what was achievable. AI is not that ChatGPT from 2023 anymore, it's something completely different.

For that reason I decided to invest this year in researching this topic. It's amazing what we can build with agentic coding, it's surreal how fast I'm actually learning topics that I simply "didn't have time" to study in the past.

Rikugan is just one of many projects I've built in the last 3 months. Actually, Rikugan was built in its first version in 1 night! In 2 days it already supported both IDA and Binary Ninja. In 3 days, it was basically what you see here with minor tweaks.

This is a work in progress, with many areas of improvement. I took care enough that this wouldn't be another AI slop, but I'm certain there are areas of improvement here. I hope you'll use it for the best. If you have bugs, suggestions, or QoL improvements, please open an issue.

That's all, thanks.
